My notes and programs for C# intended for educational purposes. Already has the following modules:

Inheritance:
1. Overriding the base class. 'override' and 'new' keywords. The difference between them.
2. Virtual functions and how they work. Virtual method table.
3. What are early and late bindings. What is the difference between them.
4. Abstract classes. Interfaces. The difference between them. 

Generics:
1. What are they. When and how to use them.
2. Constraints on generic types.
3. Generic functions in non-generic classes.
4. How are generics designed internally.
